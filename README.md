# codewars stats 


Hi, I have just started to develop this nice little codewars card. It is still in early construction and there is no warranty for functionality. 
But I will further develop it and I am happy to take any constribution :)  

Display your codewars stats in github readme:

[![Codewars](https://github.r2v.ch/codewars?user=andreasvogt89)](https://www.codewars.com/users/andreasvogt89)

Just replace username by yours and place it in your readme
```
[![Codewars](https://github.r2v.ch/codewars?user=username)](https://www.codewars.com/users/username)
```

TODO
- [X] redirect base "github.r2v.ch" to this github repo
- [ ] add parameter for card costumization
- [ ] check security 
    - [x] allow only few request per minute for every source 
- [X] release to github.r2v.ch


## Many Thanks to the guys of https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats where I got the idea to do the same for codewars :)
